## Basics of Machine Learning Lab
### Syllabus

1.Explore a dataset using Pandas. Compute attribute statistics, correlation, covariance, and
other inferential statistics.

2.Perform PCA on a dataset to reduce attributes. Compare performance with available
PCA modules in python.

3.Perform Linear regression on a dataset and compute the relevant parameters. Compute
the error in the interpolation. Compare your results with implementations in Standard modules

4.Classify a dataset with binary class distribution using logistic regression. Compute the
values for accuracy, precision and recall and present the confusion matrix. Perform all
necessary data preprocessing of the attributes involved.

5.Use logistic regression to perform OvA classification on a multi label dataset.

6.Classify a dataset using the K-NN algorithm. Perform a grid search to decide on the
optimal value of K. Report the statistics of the results obtained.

7.Use the K-NN algorithm developed in Question 6 to perform K -fold cross validation.
Compare your results with the basic implementation of the algorithm.

8.Perform binary K-Means on a dataset and compare its performance with the basic implementation of the K-Means.

9.Classify a dataset using the Naïve Bayes algorithm. Extend your algorithm to incorporate numerical attributes.

10.Cluster a dataset using the K-Means algorithm. Compute a suitable value of K using the
grid search mechanism. Report the performance metrics of your algorithm e.g.
homogeneity score, silhouette coefficient etc.

11.Write a program in python to cluster a dataset using the DBSCAN algorithm. The inputs
to the algorithm would include epsilon and “p”.

12.Perform agglomerative clustering of a dataset in python. The number of clusters would
be an input to the algorithm and your algorithm should provide options to choose the
distance metrics e.g. distance between centers, distance between nearest neighbours,
distance between farthest points etc.

13.Write a program to train a single hidden layer neural network to classify a binary dataset.

14.Write a program use Information Gain to decide the splitting attribute for a dataset to be
used in a decision tree classifier.

15.Use the function written in Question 14 to classify a dataset using a Decision tree.
