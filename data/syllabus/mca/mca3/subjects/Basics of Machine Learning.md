## Basics of Machine Learning

### Module I
`Introduction to Machine Learning`
Machine Learning – what and why? Supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Basics of
Linear Algebra - matrices and vectors, Eigen value decomposition, principal component analysis.

### Module II
Supervised Learning Linear Regression with one variable, cost function, gradient descent for linear regression. Linear
regression with multiple variables, normal equation, gradient descent. Logistic regression, cost
function, gradient descent. Regularization - the problem of overfitting, regularization in linear
regression and logistic regression. 

### Module III
Dimensionality reduction- Principal components. Decision Tree, Overfitting and Pruning,
Support Vector Machine and Kernel; Noise, bias-variance trade-off, under-fitting and overfitting concepts. 

### Module IV

Neural Networks representations, forward propagation, multi class classification. neural networks
cost function, backpropagation algorithm. Regularization and bias/ variance. Recurrent networks.

### Module V
`Unsupervised and Semi Supervised Learning`
Clustering - K-means partitional clustering, choosing the number of clusters. Hierarchical
Agglomerative Clustering. Expectation maximization (EM) for soft clustering. Semi-supervised
learning with EM using labeled and unlabeled data. Brief introduction to ML applications in
computer vision, speech and natural language processing, etc.
