## OBJECT ORIENTED DESIGN USING JAVA LAB

### List of Programs as Assignments:

`Objective: To Understand and Implement basic OOP features`

1.Write a Program to design a class having static member function named showcount() which has
the property of displaying the number of objects created of the class.

2.Write a Program which creates & uses array of object of a class.( for eg. implementing the list
of Managers of a Company having details such as Name, Age, etc..).

`Objective: To Understand and Implement special types of functions like friend function`

3.Write a Program to swap private data members of classes named as class_1, class_2 using
friend function.

4.Write an inline function to find largest of three number

`Objective: To Understand and Implement the concept of constructors`

5.Write a Program using copy constructor to copy data of an object to another object.

6.Write a program to perform addition of two complex numbers using constructor overloading.The first constructor which takes no argument is used to create objects which are not initialized,
second which takes one argument is used to initialize real and imag parts to equal values and
third which takes two argument is used to initialized real and imag to two different values.

`Objective: To Understand and Implement the concept of Polymorphism`

7.Write a program for overloading operator++ and operator—using friend functions

8.Write a program for developing a matrix class which can handle integer matrices of different
dimensions. Also overload the operator for addition, multiplication & comparison of matrices.

9.Write a program to compute area of right angle triangle, equilateral triangle, isosceles triangle
using function overloading concept.


`Objective: To Understand and Implement the concept of Inheritance`

10.Write a Program to design a student class representing student roll no. and a test class (derived
class of student) representing the scores of the student in various subjects and sports class
representing the score in sports. The sports and test class should be inherited by a result class
having the functionality to add the scores and display the final result for a student.

11.Write a Program illustrating how the constructors are implemented and the order in which
they are called when the classes are inherited. Use three classes named alpha, beta, gamma such
that alpha, beta are base class and gamma is derived class inheriting alpha & beta.

`Objective: To Understand and Implement exception handling`

12.Write a program to raise an exception if any attempt is made to refer to an element whose
index is beyond the array size.
Objective: To Understand and Implement File Operations

13.Write a program to read the class object of student info such as name , age ,sex ,height and
weight from the keyboard and to store them on a specified file using read() and write() functions.
Again the same file is opened for reading and displaying the contents of the file on the screen.
