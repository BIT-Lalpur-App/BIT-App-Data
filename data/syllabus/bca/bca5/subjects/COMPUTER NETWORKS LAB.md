## COMPUTER NETWORKS LAB
### SYLLABUS
1.To familiarize with the Lab Network Topology, locating different interfaces, routers and switches.

2.Study different pools of IP addresses. 

3.To learn and observe the usage of different networking commands e.g. hostname, ipconfig, arp, 
 nbstat, netdiag, netstate, nslookup, ping, tracert, pathping, route, etc. Learning remote login using 
 telnet session. Measuring typical average delays between different locations of the network. 

4.Implement the data link layer framing methods such as character, character stuffing, and bit stuffing.

5.“Ping” is a command used to determine if a server is responding and to estimate the roundtrip time of 
a message sent to that server. Use the ping command for the following URLs and record the success 
or failure statistics along with the average round trip time. 

    a. google.com 

    b. msn.com 

    c. bitmesra.ac.in 

6.Trace the route that is taken when you try to access: 

   a) google.com b) msn.com c) bitmesra.ac.in 

7.Learn basic networkingcommands on Linux / Unix and other operating systems.

8.Write a program to determine if the IP address is in Class A, B, C, D, or E.

9.Write a program to translate dotted decimal IP address into 32 bit address.

10.Write a program to perform bit stuffing and de-stuffing.

11.Write a program to get the ip address and host name for a given URL.

12.To implement socket programming, write a program to display date and time fromserver to client using TCP Sockets.

13.Write a program to send a message from server to client using UDP Sockets.

14.Write a program to send and receive a message from Server to Client and vice a versa using TCP socket.

15.Write a program to implement an echo server.

16.Write a program to simulate address resolution protocol (ARP).

17.Write a program to simulate reverse address resolution protocol (RARP).

18.Write a program to execute a command on remote server, issued by a client.

19.Write a program to generate the digital waveform for a given bit string using following digital encoding schemes: 

    a.NRZ – L 
     
    b.NRZ – I 

    c.Bipolar AMI 

    d.Pseudo ternary

    e.Manchester 

    f.Differential Manchester 

20.Write a program to generate the VRC-LRC code for a given message.Introduce an error (Single bit/ Multiple bit) at random location in the message and detect the error.

21.Write a program to generate the Checksum code for a given message.Introduce an error at random location in the message and verify that you can detect the error.

22.Write a program to generate the CRC code for a given message and CRC polynomial.Introduce a single bit error at random location in the message and verify that you can detect the error.

23.Write a program to implement the Hamming Code method for error detection and error correction.

24.Write a program to compute the least cost path from a user specified source node to all other nodes for a given network using Dijakstra’s algorithm.Display the path and path cost for each node.

25.Write a program to compute the least cost path from a user specified source node to all other nodes for a given network using Bellman-Ford’s algorithm.Display the path and path cost for each node.

26.Write a program to simulate the Stop & Wait automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol for a randomly generated sequence of frames and acknowledgments with error.

27.Write a program to simulate the Sliding Window automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol for a randomly generated sequence of frames and acknowledgments with error.

28.Create a socket program for HTTP web page upload and download.

29.Take a 64 bit plain text and encrypt the same using DES algorithm.

30.Write a program to break the above DES coding.

31.Using RSA algorithm encrypts a text data and Decrypt the same.
