## Concepts of Programming Languages

### Module 1: Introduction
`Introduction:` Role of programming languages – Need to study programming languages –
Characteristics of a good programming languages – Introduction to various programming
paradigms: Procedural – Object-oriented – Logic and functional – Concurrent
programming. Data Types: Properties of structured and non-structured data types and
Objects – Variables – Constants – Derived and abstract data types – Declaration – Type
checking. Binding and binding times – Type conversion – Scalar data type – Composite
data types – Implementation and Storage representation of data types and control flow
statement. 

### Module 2: SEQUENCE CONTROL
`Sequence Control:` Implicit and explicit sequence control – Sequencing with arithmetic
and non-arithmetic expressions – Sequence control between statements. Subprograms
control: Subprogram sequence control – Attributes of data control – Shared data in. 

### Module – III OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
`Object Oriented Programming:` The class declarations – Constructors – Information hiding
and data abstraction using classes – Access specification – Inheritance – Polymorphism –
Parameterized types – Exception handling. 

### Module – IVLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
`Logic Programming:` Logic programming language model – Logical statements – Resolution – unification – search structures: backward and forward – Applications of logic programming – PROLOG. Functional Programming: Features of functional
languages – LISP – Applications of functional and logic programming languages.

### Module –V CONCURRENT PROGRAMMING
`Basic concepts of Concurrent Programming:` processes – Synchronization primitives –
Safety and liveness properties – Parallelism in Hardware – Streams – Concurrency as
interleaving – Safe access to shared data.
