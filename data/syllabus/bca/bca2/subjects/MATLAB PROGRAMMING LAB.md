3.Invoke MATLAB interactively and perform the following steps.

    a) Initialize a variable x to 2.
    b) Add 3 to x. Print out the result
    c) Print out the result of x + 1*2 and (x+1)*2 .(Observe how parentheses make a difference).
    d) What variable type is x?
    e) Write a program to Demonstrate by using several values of angle θ that sin2(θ) + cos2 (θ)=1.



4.Given a vector t, write down the MATLAB expressions that will c

&emsp; a. ln(2 + t + t<sup>2</sup>)

&emsp; b. e<sup>t</sup>(1 + cos(3t))

&emsp; c. cos<sup>2</sup>(t) + sin<sup>2</sup>(t)

&emsp; d. tan<sup>-1</sup>(t) (this is the inverse tange

&emsp; e. cot(t)

&emsp; f. sec<sup>2</sup>(t) + cot(t) - 1

5.Make a plot of x = [0:0.1:20]; y = sin(x).

6.Write a program to Draw the graph that joins the points (0,1), (4,3), (2,0) and (5,-2).

7.Write a program to. create a row of data under the variable name x
x=[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10] add 7 to the data and multiply with 8.

Calculate A + B and B + A to show that addition of matrices is commutative.

12.Calculate A + (B+C) and (A+B) + C to show that addition of matrices is associative

13.Calculate 5(A + C) and 5A + SC to show that, When matrices are multiplied by a scalar, the multiplicationis distributive.

14.Write a MATLAB program to find the sum of numbers from 1 to 9.

15.Find and display all integers between I and 10000 which divide by 37.

16.Fibonacci numbers form a sequence starting with O followed by I. Each subsequent number is the sum Of
the previous two. Hence the sequence starts as O, l, l, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, Calculate and display the first IO even Fibonacci numbers.

17.Calculate A*(B+C) and A*B + A*C to show that matrix multiplication is distributive.

18.Calculate (by writing one command) the radius r of a sphere that has a volume of 350 in<sup>3</sup>.Once r is determined, calculate the surface area of the sphere.

19.Write a MATLAB code to Create a new function, that multiply 2 numbers, and use it.

20.Write a function called F to C to convert Fahrenheit temperatures into Celsius.

21.Write a script that generates an array of 6 random numbers between O and IO.

22.Plot the function
