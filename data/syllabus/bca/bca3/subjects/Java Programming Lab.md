### Syllabus

1.WAJP to show the characteristic of a number. {E.g. 24 it has two coefficients 2 in tens position and 4
in units position. It is composed of 2 and 3. It is a positive number. Also show whether it is odd or
even.

2.WAJP to take input through command line argument and do the following:

&nbsp; a) Check whether the number is prime.
&nbsp; b) Generate the reverse a number.

3.Write a menu driven program using switch in Java to perform following:

&nbsp; a) For input of 1, check whether the number is prime

&nbsp; b) For input of 3, find the factors of the number

&nbsp; c) For input of 5, check the number is odd or even.

4.Write a program in Java to generate hexadecimal equivalent of a number without using array.

5.WAJP to take two number inputs through command line argument and do the following a) Check whether two numbers are prime to each other or not.

b) Fide the LCM of two numbers.

6.WAJP to create a class and exhibit the role of static functions (other than main) by declaring,
defining and calling them.

7.WAJP to compute and display the count of occurrence of 4 in a number. E.g. 4564 Will compute 2.

8.WAJP to take an angle value in degrees and then compute the equivalent radians and then prove
sin<sup>2</sup>(θ)+cos<sup>2</sup>(θ) = 1, Note 180 degrees = π radians.

9.WAJP to sort a list of numbers in ascending order.

10.WAJP to generate Pascal's Triangle using a square matrix.

11.Write a program in Java to take input of two matrices through command line argument and then:

&nbsp; a) Add them up and display the result

&nbsp; b) Subtract them and display the result

&nbsp; c) Multiply them and display product

12.WAJP to count the number of words, characters in a sentence.

13.Write a program in Java to take input of a sentence through command line argument and then count the number of words and vowels.

14.WAJP to handle the Exception using try and multiple catch block; the exceptions that you will
handle are, number format error, array bound error and divide by zero.

15.WAJP to create a class called Room with two data member length and width and then implement
constructor overloading in it.

16.Write a program in Java to explain the role of the following:

&nbsp; a) Non-parameterized constructor

&nbsp; b) Parameterized constructor

&nbsp; c) Copy constructor (take input and display the output.)

17.WAJP to create a class called Fraction with data member numerator and denominator; take input (through command line argument) of two fractions and then add, subtract, multiply and divide,finally display the result in reduced term.

18.Write a program in Java to create a class for `Employee` having 2 data member code and name. Then create 3 classes `Officer`, `AdminStaff` and `MStaff`. The `Officer` class has data members designation and pay-scale; the `AdminStaff` has data members grade and pay-band; the `MStaff` has data member department and two sub-classes `Regular` and `Casual`. The `Regular` staff has data members level and consolidated-pay and `Casual` has data member daily-wage. Take all inputs through constructors and write appropriate methods for displaying one data for each type of class.

19.WAJP to design a class called `Account` using the inheritance and static that show all function of
bank (withdrawal, deposit) and generate account number dynamically.

20.WAJP to design an application `Password` that produces and prints a random password depending upon name of an individual. If the input is Abdul Kalam then the password would be `33421LAM`. Note: take the first name A=1, B=2, D=4, U=21 where 2+1=3, and L=12, where 1+2=3,so the number comes to be 12433,so the number comes to be 12433.

21.WAJP to draw a format like :-

```
              *
            * * *
          * * * * *
        * * * * * * *
          * * * * *
            * * *
              *
```

22.WAJP to take a string count all vowels and then delete the same from the string.

23.Write a `Patient` class which inherits from the `Person` class. Patient can again be of two types, indoor and outdoor. The Patient class requires the following:

&nbsp; a) a variable to store the patient ID for the patient

&nbsp; b) a variable to store the department of hospital

&nbsp; c) a variable to store the ward of hospital

&nbsp; d) a variable to store the patient 's date of joining the hospital

&nbsp; e) a variable to store the patient 's address

&nbsp; f) a variable to store the medical fees that the patient pays

&nbsp; g) constructor methods, which initialize the variables
patient)

24.WAJP to take a string as password and check whether it contains at least two numbers, 3 alphabets
and no space in it. If any contrary throw message.

25.Write a program in Java to create a class called Rational having two data members for numerator
and denominator. Take two inputs of rational numbers and perform multiplication and division.Display the result in reduced form.

26.Write a program in Java to print a format like,

```
        * * * * * * *
          * * * * *
            * * *
              *
```

27.Write a class called `Shape` which contains a user-defined interface for `Computation`, which contains methods for calculation of area, perimeter and volume. Write four classes for `circle`, `rectangle`,`sphere` and `rectangular parallelepiped`, and all these classes inherit from Shape. Now take input for the following :-

&nbsp; a) radius of circle and compute its area andperimeter

&nbsp; b) length and breadth of rectangle and compute itsarea and perimeter

&nbsp; c) Length, breadth and height for rectangular parallelepiped and compute its area and volume

&nbsp; d) radius of sphere and compute its area and volume

28.Write a class called Employee, which requires the following :

&nbsp; a) a variable to store the employee ID employee IDshould be
of format EMPM1234,EMPS1234, EMPA1234,EMPC1234,where
M=manager, S=supervisor, A=analyst,C=clerk; number can be any no. but first threecharacters should be EMP

&nbsp; b) a variable to store the employee name.

&nbsp; c) a variable to store department.

&nbsp; d) a variable to store city.

&nbsp; e) a variable to store basic salary

&nbsp; f) a method to calculate the salary of employee
if the city is metro then the HRA would be 30% else20% if the employee ID contain M then DA would be120%, if S then DA would be 110%, if A then DA wouldbe 100%, and if C then DA would be 90%

&nbsp; g) constructor methods, which initialize the variables

29.WAJP to create 4 threads and show exhibit their execution after the call of the “start ( )”
method.Write a program in Java to create 3 threads and exhibit their behaviour by changing their
priorities in the “main” thread. Display the possible output.
