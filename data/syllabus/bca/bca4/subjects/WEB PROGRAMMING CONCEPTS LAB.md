1. India is a large country. Different regions observe variations in climate. The spoken language of one 
state is quite different from that of another. They wear different types of garments. They celebrate different 
festivals and perform varied religious rites. People belonging to diverse cultures belong to different religious 
faiths. In spite of these diversities, Indians feel a sense of unity and oneness among them. Thus, we conclude 
that India is a land of Unity in Diversity.
