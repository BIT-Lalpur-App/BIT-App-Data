## INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER ALGORITHMS

### Module 1 

`Introduction:` What is an algorithm? Design and performance analysis of algorithms, space and time
trade-offs. Analysis of selection sort and insertion sort. Asymptotic notations (O, è, ¿,ωο)
to measure complexity of algorithms.


### Module 2
`Recursion:` Basic concept. Analysis of recursive algorithms, Master's theorem. Divide & Conquer:
The general method. binary search, finding the maximum and minimum, merge sort,
quick sort, Best and worst case analysis for the mentioned algorithms.

### Module 3
`The Greedy Method:`The general method. Applications to Knapsack problem, minimum weight spanning trees:
Prim’s &Kruskal’s algorithms. Dijkstra's algorithm for finding single source shortest
paths problem.

### Module 4

Graph, Topological Sorting

### Module 5
`Basic concepts of Backtracking:`8-queen problem, Branch and Bound: 0/1 Knapsack problem, assignment problem
